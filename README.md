## Installation:

- Our group used Python to implement the program

- The source code is on Google Colaboratory
- The following link is the source code of our group: https://colab.research.google.com/github/Kyle-kclee/cmsc5702-asgn2a-MapReduce/blob/main/MapReduce.ipynb

- Upload the input file (HTML files) directly under the path "/content/" and right click for upload before running the program

- Install "pyspark" pakage before running the program

- If the Google Colab notebook cannot be used, please visit the following GitHub link to download our source code: https://github.com/Kyle-kclee/cmsc5702-asgn2a-MapReduce

## Testing:

- The result of our program is shown in the following image

- There are some variances in href count from the sample output, including the following:
  - `#` - 176 (179 in sample output)
  - `http://stanfordmedicine.org/flu/` - 22 (23 in sample output) 

  
- It is found that some `<a>` tag lies inside the comment block, thus being ignored by the Beautiful Soup library. \
  Below shows an example in `147.html` that leads to the variance of `http://stanfordmedicine.org/flu/`
